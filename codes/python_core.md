* All instructions in a block should have same indentations.
    ```python
    # run successfully
    if 5 > 2:
      print("Five is greater than two!") 
    if 5 > 2:
            print("Five is greater than two!") 

    # run with indentation error
    if 5 > 2:
      print("Five is greater than two!")
            print("Five is greater than two!")
    ```
